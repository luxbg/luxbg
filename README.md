# Hey, I'm Mohamed Hamed

Fullstack dev who somehow ended up building on the blockchain instead of fixing my WIFI.  
I write TypeScript, Swift, and Kotlin mostly so I can argue with myself in three different languages.  

Current status: Debugging my own debug logs.  
Goal: Ship code before coffee gets cold.
